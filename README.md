# Postmate

A toy project to simulate transforming data from files and sending data to an endpoint.

Mostly practice with Pandas and Click.

# Installation

1. Make a virtualenv (I use pyenv)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python postmate.py --help`

# Usage

1. `python postmate.py --endpoint <your_endpoint>`

By default, records are NOT sent.  You need to set `--for-real True`.
